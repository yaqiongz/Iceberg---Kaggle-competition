This folder contains my work on the recent Kaggle challange: Iceberg classification using remote sensing images,[Statoil/C-CORE Iceberg Classifier Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/statoil-iceberg-classifier-challenge). I built a basic CNN model first. And then I added other elements into it, such as image argumentations, transfer learning from VGG16, a random forest model using the bottleneck features of the VGG16.

A lot of my code are adapted from tutorials from Keras and kaggle kernals. Thanks to them!
