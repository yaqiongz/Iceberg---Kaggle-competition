This folder contains my work on the recent Kaggle challange: Iceberg classification using remote sensing images. I build a basic CNN model first. And then I added other elements into it, such as image argumentations, transfer learning from VGG16, random forest model using the bottleneck features of the VGG16.

A lot of my code are adapted from tutorials from Keras and kaggle kernals. Thanks to them!
